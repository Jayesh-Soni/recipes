Ingredients needed:

   -Parle-G biscuits - 20 biscuits
   -Hide and Seek Biscuit - 20 biscuits
   -Powdered sugar - 3 tbsp
   -Milk - 1 cup (lukewarm)
   -Vanilla essence - 3/4 tsp
   -Eno/Fruit Salt - 1 packed (plain-non flavored)
   -Cashew nuts or almonds - 3 tbsp chopped (optional)

Method:

-Powder the biscuits (hide and seek and parle-G) separately in a mixer. Then mix both well.
-Add powdered sugar, cashew nuts (if using) and mix well.
-Add vanilla essence, milk (little at a time) and mix without lumps to get a smooth batter. I added one cup of milk.
-Transfer the batter to the greased baking tin, place it on the pan or cooker and steam cook covered. You should not allow the batter to rest after adding fruit salt. You should steam immediately after adding Eno/Fruit salt (keep a stand inside the pan  as shown in picture below and place the baking pan/tin over it)
Before adding eno/fruit salt, bring water to boil in a steamer or cooker or any pan and keep it ready.Add eno and mix well with a spatula.
-Steam for the first 15 minutes on high flame. Picture below shows after 15 minutes of steaming.
-Then keep the flame/heat low and steam for another 10-15 minutes. Insert a toothpick in the center of the cake to check if it is cooked. If it comes out clean, it is cooked.
 Leave it to cool in the cake tin. After it is cooled, remove the cake from the tin. Run a knife around the edges and invert it on a plate. Cut the cake after it is completely cooled.
